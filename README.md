A live time experiment exploring the "Six Degrees of Seperation" As my spider bot crawls through Twitter


Six degrees of separation.
"Six degrees of separation is the idea that all living things and everything else in the world are six or fewer steps away from each other so that a chain of "a friend of a friend" statements can be made to connect any two people in a maximum of six steps. It was originally set out by Frigyes Karinthy in 1929 and popularized in an eponymous 1990 play written by John Guare. "  From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
